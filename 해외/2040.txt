2041@WUTHERINGHEIGHTS-PENGUINCL @BRONTE@PENGUIN@6640@The passionate love of Catherine Earnshaw and Heathcliff mirrors the powerful moods of the Yorkshire moors.Lockwood, the new tenant of Thrushcross Grange on the bleak Yorkshire moors, is forced to seek shelter one night at Wuthering Heights, the home of his landlord. There he discovers the history of the tempestuous events that took place years before: of the intense passion between the foundling Heathcliff and Catherine Earnshaw, and her betrayal of him. As Heathcliff's bitterness and vengeance is now visited upon the next generation, their innocent heirs must struggle to escape the legacy of the past.In this edition, a new preface by Lucasta Miller, author of The Bronte Myth, looks at the ways in which the novel has been interpreted, from Charlotte Bronte onwards. This complements Pauline Nestor's introduction, which discusses changing critical receptions of the novel, as well as Emily Bronte's influences and background.Published a year before her death at the age of thirty, Emily Bronte's only novel is? set in the wild, bleak Yorkshire Moors. Depicting the relationship of Cathy and Heathcliff, Wuthering Heights creates a world of its own, conceived with an instinct for poetry and for the dark depths of human psychology.       @HeathBar The house is now mine. Since the neighbor has Catherine, I'll seduce his sister. We'll see how brave he is when she's got Heathcock in her.   Girl is preggers. Catherine is dead. My world is over. I've become an evil, evil man. Naming my son Heathcliff Jr.   From Twitterature: The World's Greatest Books in Twenty Tweets or Less@

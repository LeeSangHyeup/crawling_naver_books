2059@Olive's Ocean @케빈 헹크스@Harper Collins@5720@OLIVE BARSTOW WAS IN MARTHA BOYLE'S CLASS UNTIL SHE WAS KILLED BY A HIT-AND-RUN DRIVER WHILE RIDING HER BICYCLE. MARTHA DIDN'T KNOW OLIVE -- NOT REALLY. BUT AFTER OLIVE'S MOTHER GIVES HER A SECTION FROM OLIVE'S JOURNAL, MARTHA KNOWS THEY COULD HAVE BEEN, WOULD HAVE BEEN FRIENDS. AND NOW MARTHA AND HER FAMILY ARE GOING TO VISIT GODBEE, MARTHA'S GRANDMOTHER, ON CAPE COD FOR THE REST OF THE SUMMER -- AS THEY DO EVERY YEAR. THE BOYLES DESCENT OF GODBEE'S SMALL HOUSE IN A FLURRY OF EXUBERANCE, MINI-CRISES, DIAPERS, AND HUMOR ALL MIXED TOGETHER. THE OCEAN IS STILL THERE. AND THE FIVE MANNING BOYS STILL LIVE NEARBY. THERE IS JIMMY MANNING WITH HIS EVER-PRESENT VIDEO CAMERA. JIMMY MANNING, WHO GIVES MARTHA HER FIRST KISS. AND TATE, WHO SEEMS TO FOLLOW MARTHA WITH HIS EYES. AND THEN THERE IS OLIVE, WHO HAD ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE THE OCEAN, AND WHO NOW HAUNTS MARTHA'S THOUGHTS AND DREAMS.--- FROM THE PUBLISHER@

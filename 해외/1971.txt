1972@Nudge @Cass R. Sunstein@Penguin Books@13190@NUDGE IS ABOUT CHOICES - HOW WE MAKE THEM AND HOW WE CAN MAKE BETTER ONES. AUTHORS RICHARD H. THALER AND CASS R. SUNSTEIN OFFER A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON PREVENTING THE COUNTLESS MISTAKES WE MAKE - INCLUDING ILL-ADVISED PERSONAL INVESTMENTS, CONSUMPTION OF UNHEALTHY FOODS, NEGLECT OF OUR NATURAL RESOURCES, AND OTHER BAD DECISIONS. CITING DECADES OF CUTTING-EDGE BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE RESEARCH, THEY DEMONSTRATE THAT SENSIBLE 'CHOICE ARCHITECTURE' CAN SUCCESSFULLY NUDGE PEOPLE TOWARDS THE BEST DECISIONS WITHOUT RESTRICTING THEIR FREEDOM OF CHOICE. STRAIGHTFORWARD, INFORMATIVE, AND ENTERTAINING, THIS IS A MUST-READ FOR ANYONE WITH INTEREST IN OUR INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE WELL-BEING.@

저자 : THALER, RICHARD H.RICHARD H. THALER IS A PIONEER IN THE FIELDS OF BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS AND FINANCE.ALTHOUGH HIS FIRST WRITINGS ON BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS APPEARED IN 1980, THALER BECAME MORE PROMINENT BETWEEN 1987 AND 1990 WHEN HE WROTE A REGULAR COLUMN CALLED “ANOMALIES”, PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES. IN HIS COLUMN HE WROTE ON A MYRIAD OF SUBJECTS THAT ILLUSTRATED THE WAYS IN WHICH HUMAN BEHAVIOR SEEMED TO VIOLATE TRADITIONAL ECONOMIC THEORIES. THESE COLUMNS WERE LATER PUBLISHED IN THE COLLECTION THE WINNER’S CURSE. DANIEL KAHNEMAN LATER CITED HIS JOINT WORK WITH THALER AS A “MAJOR FACTOR” IN HIS RECEIVING THE BANK OF SWEDEN PRIZE IN ECONOMIC SCIENCES IN MEMORY OF ALFRED NOBEL. COMMENTING ON THE PRIZE, HE SAID, “THE COMMITTEE CITED ME ‘FOR HAVING INTEGRATED INSIGHTS FROM PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH INTO ECONOMIC SCIENCE’. ALTHOUGH I DO NOT WISH TO RENOUNCE ANY CREDIT FOR MY CONTRIBUTION, I SHOULD SAY THAT IN MY VIEW THE WORK OF INTEGRATION WAS ACTUALLY DONE MOSTLY BY THALER AND THE GROUP OF YOUNG ECONOMISTS THAT QUICKLY BEGAN TO FORM AROUND HIM.” THALER IS CURRENTLY THE RALPH AND DOROTHY KELLER DISTINGUISHED SERVICE PROFESSOR OF BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE AND ECONOMICS, AND DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR DECISION RESEARCH, GRADUATE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO.

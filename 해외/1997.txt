1998@Old Yeller @Fred Gipson@HarperTrophy@6200@서부 개척 시대를 배경으로 아름다운 이야기 속에 슬픔을 담아 한 소년이 성숙해가는 과정을 그린 동화. 지독한 성장통을 겪은 후 인생과 한 가정을 책임지는 성인으로, 커다란 슬픔을 가슴에 묻고 다시 일어서는 남성으로 성장한다. 삶과 죽음, 만남과 헤어짐, 아픔과 성숙이 함께 담겨 있어 눈물 반짝이게 만드는 이야기. 1957년 뉴베리 아너 상, 1959년 윌리엄 앨런 화이트 상을 수상했다.At first, Travis couldn't stand the sight of Old Yeller.The stray dog was ugly, and a thieving rascal, too. But he sure was clever, and a smart dog could be a big help on the wild Texas frontier, especially with Papa away on a long cattle drive up to Abilene. Strong and courageous, Old Yeller proved that he could protect Travis's family from any sort of danger. But can Travis do the same for Old Yeller? A bestseller for generations, the combination of excellent writing and the sensitivity to human emotions places it on a shelf with the classics in juvenile literature.@

1888@RIVER BOY@BOWLER@SS@5160@15세 소녀의 눈에 비친, ‘만남과 헤어짐, 삶과 죽음 뒤에 숨겨진 인생의 진실’을 아름답게 그린 성장소설이다. 삶과 죽음의 진정한 의미, 영원한 이별을 받아들이는 주인공 소녀의 추억은, 앞으로 수많은 만남과 헤어짐을 통과해야 할 청소년들에게 밑바닥까지 슬퍼하고 또다시 웃는 법을 알려준다. “수많은 돌부리를 만나도 결코 멈추는 법 없는 강물처럼” 인생은 그렇게 사랑과 추억을 바탕으로 아름답게 흘러가는 것임을 이 책을 읽으면 누구나 깨닫게 된다. 이 책은 ‘상실의 순간과 그 후에 찾아오는 삶의 선물’에 대해서 이야기한다. 한쪽 문이 닫히면 다른 쪽 문이 열리는 것처럼, 그 당시에는 가슴을 후벼 파는 것처럼 괴롭지만 그 순간을 온전히 흘려보내고 나면 또다시 인생이 준비해둔 다른 선물을 발견할 수 있다는 주제를 너무 무겁지도, 너무 가볍지도 않게 십대의 눈높이에 맞춰 탁월하게 풀어냈다.She didn't know how fast the current was moving her. It could take many more hours yet, perhaps more hours than she had the strength for. But she must not stop. She must keep going. She must try to catch the river boy, even though she was frightened at the thought of what he was. Jess's beloved grandfather has just had a serious heart attack, but he insists that the family travel as planned to his boyhood home on the river so that he can finish his painting, River Boy. As Jess helps her ailing grandpa with his work, she becomes entranced by the scene he is painting. Then she becomes aware of a strange presence in the river ? a boy who asks for her help and issues a challenge that will stretch her swimming talents to their very limit. Jess knows that Grandpa and the river boy are connected, but how? Can she take up the river boy's challenge before it's too late for Grandpa? Tim Bowler's gripping narrative flows like a river itself ? gentle and calm at times, turbulent and deep at others, always fluid, always alive. Readers will be swept along by the magic of the river and the mysterious river boy ? and changed forever by Jess's unforgettable journey.@

LOUIS SACHAR WHEN LOUIS SACHAR WAS GOING TO SCHOOL, HIS TEACHERS ALWAYS PRONOUNCED HIS NAME WRONG. NOW THAT HE HAS BECOME A POPULAR AUTHOR OF CHILDREN’S BOOKS, TEACHERS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY ARE PRONOUNCING HIS NAME WRONG. IT SHOULD BE PRONOUNCED “SACKER,” LIKE SOMEONE WHO TACKLES QUARTERBACKS OR SOMEONE WHO STUFFS POTATOES INTO SACKS. MR. SACHAR RECEIVED A B.A. IN ECONOMICS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY. HIS FIRST BOOK, SIDEWAYS STORIES FROM WAYSIDE SCHOOL, WAS ACCEPTED FOR PUBLICATION DURING HIS FIRST YEAR OF LAW SCHOOL. AFTER RECEIVING HIS LAW DEGREE, HE SPENT SIX YEARS ASKING HIMSELF WHETHER HE WANTED TO BE AN AUTHOR OR A LAWYER BEFORE DECIDING TO WRITE FOR CHILDREN FULL-TIME. HIS BOOKS INCLUDE WAYSIDE SCHOOL GETS A LITTLE STRANGER, THERE’S A BOY IN THE GIRLS’ BATHROOM, WAYSIDE SCHOOL IS FALLING DOWN, DOGS DON’T TELL JOKES, AND THE MARVIN REDPOST SERIES. LOUIS SACHAR LIVES IN AUSTIN, TEXAS, WITH HIS WIFE AND THEIR DAUGHTER, SHERRE.

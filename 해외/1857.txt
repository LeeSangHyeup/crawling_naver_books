1858@Diary of a Wimpy Kid #1 (Hardcover/ International Edition) @Kinney@ABRAMS@5600@남자아이들도 일기를 쓸까? 아니면 쓰지 않을까? Diary of a Wimpy Kid는 미국의 작가이자 만화가인 제프 키니가 쓴 실화 바탕의 픽션 소설이다. 본 작품은 series의 첫 번째 편이며, 두 번째는 Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules, 그리고 최근 발표된 세 번째 편은 Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw이다. 책은 초등학교 6학년인 그렉 헤플리가 자신의 모험을 말하는 일기이다. 저자는 5권으로 시리즈를 염두해두고, 집필했으며 2009년 1월에 3편을 출간하였다. 20세기 폭스 사를 통해 영화로도 개봉될 예정이다. 새 학년이 시작되면서 그렉 헤플리는 덩치가 크고, 못된, 그리고 이미 면도까지 하고 있는 성숙한 아이들과 아직은 덩치가 작고 허약한 아이들이 복도를 같이 사용해야 하는 중학교에 입학한다. 준비되지 않은 성장의 위험을 그렉이 자신의 일기에 기록한 자신의 언어와 그림을 통해 보여준다.  Being a kid can really stink. And no one knows this better than Greg Heffley, who finds himself thrust into middle school, where undersized weaklings share the hallways with kids who are taller, meaner, and already shaving.@

저자 : KINNEY, JEFFALL HIS LIFE, JEFF KINNEY WANTED TO BE A CARTOONIST. AS A STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND IN THE 1990S, HE PUBLISHED HIS COMIC STRIP "IGDOOF" IN THE COLLEGE NEWSPAPER, BUT HE SOON DISCOVERED THAT SUCCEEDING IN THE REAL WORLD AS A SYNDICATED CARTOONIST IS NO EASY TASK. SO, AFTER SCHOOL, HE SUPPORTED HIMSELF AS A NEWSPAPER DESIGNER AND COMPUTER PROGRAMMER, WHILE WORKING OUT IDEAS FOR A CHILDREN'S BOOK THAT COMBINED CARTOONS WITH CONVENTIONAL STORYTELLING.ONCE HE CONCEIVED THE CONCEPT FOR DIARY OF A WIMPY KID, KINNEY DEVOTED NEARLY SIX YEARS TO DEVELOPING THE STORYLINE AND ARTWORK. FASHIONED AS A JOURNAL WITH APPEALING, EXPRESSIVE STICK FIGURE DRAWINGS ON EVERY PAGE, DIARY IS NARRATED IN THE PITCH-PERFECT (AND HILARIOUSLY DEADPAN) VOICE OF A NOT-ALWAYS-LIKEABLE BUT TOTALLY BELIEVABLE TWEENER NAMED GREG HAFFLEY. POISED TO MAKE THE PAINFUL TRANSITION FROM ELEMENTARY TO MIDDLE SCHOOL, GREGG STRUGGLES WITH THE USUAL PRETEEN ANGST: BULLIES AND CLIQUES, ANNOYING SIBLINGS AND CLUELESS PARENTS, FAITHFUL FRIENDS AND CUTE, UNATTAINABLE GIRLS.ALTHOUGH KINNEY NEVER INTENDED TO PUBLISH HIS BOOK ONLINE, WHEN THE OPPORTUNITY AROSE TO SERIALIZE GREG'S ADVENTURES ON FUNBRAIN.COM, HE KNEW HE'D FOUND THE PERFECT WAY TO REACH HIS TARGET AUDIENCE. IN 2004, THE COMIC STRIP BEGAN APPEARING IN DAILY INSTALLMENTS ON THE WEBSITE. THE FEATURE WAS A HUGE HIT, ATTRACTING THOUSANDS OF HITS A DAY. MOREOVER, THE ONLINE VERSION PAVED THE WAY TO KINNEY'S FIVE-BOOK DEAL WITH THE PUBLISHER HARRY N. ABRAMS.ARMED WITH FRESH, NEW STORY LINES, KINNEY LAUNCHED THE PRINT SEQUENCE IN 2007. FROM THE VERY FIRST INSTALLMENT, ENTITLED SIMPLY DIARY OF A WIMPY KID, THE SERIES WAS A SUCCESS -- ESPECIALLY WITH RELUCTANT READERS WHO FOUND THE DIARY-WITH-DOODLES FORMAT FAR MORE ACCESSIBLE THAN CONVENTIONAL BOOKS. GREGG, WITH HIS HILARIOUS ANTICS, BACKFIRING SCHEMES, AND TOTALLY UNFILTERED THOUGHTS (HIS MOM HAS AGREED NOT TO READ WHAT HE WRITES!), HAS STRUCK A RESPONSIVE CHORD -- BOTH WITH KIDS WHO IDENTIFY WITH HIS GROWING PAINS AND WITH GROWNUPS WHO VIVIDLY RECALL THEIR OWN.

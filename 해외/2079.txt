2080@OF MICE AND MEN @STEINBECK@PENGUIN@7900@<분노의 포도>, <에덴의 동쪽>의 작가 스타인벡의 대표작. 캘리포니아 농장 지대를 배경으로, 두 명의 떠돌이 노동자의 희망과 비극이 그려진다. 제목 <생쥐와 인간 Of Mice and Men>은 스코틀랜드 시인 로버트 번즈의 시에서 따온 것이다.자신만의 땅을 마련해 콩을 심고 토끼를 기르고-그런 소박한 소망을 무심히 파괴해버리는 숙명과 작은 오해에 관해 이야기하는 소설이다. '생쥐와 인간의 소중한 계획은/ 너무 자주 뒤틀려버리곤 한다/ 그리하여 약속된 기쁨 대신/ 슬픔과 고통에 찬 덧없음만을 남겨준다'는 싯귀가 이 소설의 주제를 함축한다.They are an unlikely pair: George is "small and quick and dark of face"; Lennie, a man of tremendous size, has the mind of a young child. Yet they have formed a "family," clinging together in the face of lonelinss and alienation. Laborers in California's dusty vegetable fields, they hustle work when they can, living a hand-to-mouth existence. For George and Lennie have a plan: to own an acre of land and a shack they can call their own. When they land jobs on a ranch in the Salinas Valley, the fulfillment of their dream seems to be within their grasp. But even George cannot guard Lennie from the provocations of a flirtatious woman, nor predict the consequences of Lennie's unswerving obedience to the things George taught him. "A thriller, a gripping tale . . . that you will not set down until it is finished. Steinbeck has touched the quick." ─ The New York Times@

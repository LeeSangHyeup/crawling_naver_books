2027@Coraline (Paperback) @NEIL GAIMAN@Harpercollins Childrens Books@5790@미국 컬트 만화의 대부로 불리는 '샌드맨' 시리즈의 작가 닐 게이먼이 어린이를 위한 쓴 첫 번째 동화로 출간되었을 당시 ‘이상한 나라의 앨리스가 돌아왔다!’라는 이야기를 들은 작품이다. 현대판 앨리스로 불리는 '코랄린'은 공포판타지의 결정판이며, 환상적이며 매력적인 스토리라는 찬사를 받으며 세계의 어린이들에게 사랑받고 있는 공포판타지 소설이다. 갈색의 문, 단추 눈을 가진 사람들, 날카로운 손톱으로 기분 나쁜 소리를 내며 다니는 하얀 손가락…. 코랄린의 이야기 속 곳곳에서 섬뜩한 공포가 묻어나지만 단순한 공포 소설은 아니다. 한 소녀가 공포에 맞서 용감하게 싸워 극복하여, 세상에서 가장 소중한 가족, 부모님을 지켜내는 이야기로 전혀 어울릴 것 같지 않은 공포와 가족애가 조화를 이룬 새로운 버전의 판타지 동화다.The day after they moved in, Coraline went exploring.... In Coraline's family's new flat are twenty-one windows and fourteen doors. Thirteen of the doors open and close.The fourteenth is locked, and on the other side is only a brick wall, until the day Coraline unlocks the door to find a passage to another flat in another house just like her own.Only it's different.At first, things seem marvelous in the other flat. The food is better. The toy box is filled with wind-up angels that flutter around the bedroom, books whose pictures writhe and crawl and shimmer, little dinosaur skulls that chatter their teeth. But there's another mother, and another father, and they want Coraline to stay with them and be their little girl. They want to change her and never let her go.Other children are trapped there as well, lost souls behind the mirrors. Coraline is their only hope of rescue. She will have to fight with all her wits and all the tools she can find if she is to save the lost children, her ordinary life, and herself.Critically acclaimed and award-winning author Neil Gaiman will delight readers with his first novel for all ages.@

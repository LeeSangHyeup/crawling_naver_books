저자 : LEI, HONGCHINESE CONCEPTUALIST HONG LEI IS PERHAPS BEST KNOWN FOR HIS ELUSIVE PHOTO-BASED WORKS THAT APPROPRIATE THE ICONOGRAPHY OF ANCIENT CHINESE PAINTING. BORN IN 1960 IN CHANGZHOU, CHINA, HONG BEGAN AS A PAINTER, HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY BOTH BASELITZ AND KOKOSCHKA. STILL WORKING IN HIS HOME CITY, THE ARTIST HAS NOT ENTIRELY ABANDONED HIS EARLY INCLINATIONS, BUT IN HIS RECENT WORK HAS INSIGHTFULLY FUSED TRADITIONAL CHINESE MOTIFS WITH WESTERN ESTHETIC STRATEGIES.

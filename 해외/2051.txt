2052@SEPARATE PEACEÂ @Knowles@SCRIBNER@12630@SET AT A BOYS' BOARDING SCHOOL IN NEW ENGLAND DURING THE EARLY YEARS OF WORLD WAR II, A SEPARATE PEACE IS A HARROWING AND LUMINOUS PARABLE OF THE DARK SIDE OF ADOLESCENCE. GENE IS A LONELY, INTROVERTED INTELLECTUAL. PHINEAS IS A HANDSOME, TAUNTING, DAREDEVIL ATHLETE. WHAT HAPPENS BETWEEN THE TWO FRIENDS ONE SUMMER, LIKE THE WAR ITSELF, BANISHES THE INNOCENCE OF THESE BOYS AND THEIR WORLD.A BESTSELLER FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS, A SEPARATE PEACE IS JOHN KNOWLES'S CROWNING ACHIEVEMENT AND AN UNDISPUTED AMERICAN CLASSIC.@

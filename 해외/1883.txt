저자 : SPARKS, NICHOLASNICHOLAS SPARKS EVER SINCE THE NOTEBOOK MADE NICHOLAS SPARKS A WORD-OF-MOUTH PUBLISHING SENSATION IN 1996, HE HAS MAINTAINED HIS STATUS AS A BESTSELLING AUTHOR OF TRAGEDY-TINGED LOVE STORIES. HIS SPARE, SIMPLY THEMED NOVELS STAR ORDINARY PEOPLE OVERCOME BY EXTRAORDINARY EMOTIONS, AND CHANGED BY THEM. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT SPARKS MIGHT HAVE ENJOYED HIS LEVEL OF POPULARITY BY WRITING THESE STORIES STRICTLY FROM IMAGINATION, BUT IN FACT HIS FAMILY'S STRUGGLES PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN MANY OF HIS BOOKS, ESPECIALLY THE EARLIEST NOVELS. (FOR EXAMPLETHE NOTEBOOK, HIS TALE OF A GREAT LOVE AFFAIR EXTENDING INTO OLD AGE, WAS INSPIRED BY HIS WIFE'S GRANDPARENTS; MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE DREW FROM SPARKS' FATHER'S LIFE STORY AND A WALK TO REMEMBER FROM HIS LATE SISTER'S.) IN ADDITION, A THREE-WEEK TRIP HE AND HIS OLDER SIBLING MICAH UNDERTOOK IN 2003 BECAME THE BASIS FOR THREE WEEKS WITH MY BROTHER, A UNIQUE MEMOIR AS MOVING AND TENDERHEARTED AS ANY OF HIS FICTION. SPARKS IS VERY METHODICAL ABOUT HIS WRITING, AN APPROACH HE MAKES TRANSPARENT ON HIS WEB SITE WITH SEVERAL ESSAYS, UPDATES ON WORKS IN PROGRESS, AND NOTES ON THE MECHANICS OF HIS NOVELS. UNSURPRISINGLY, CRITICS HAVE FAULTED HIM FOR BEING TOO FORMULAIC OR CLICHED. STILL, SPARKS NEVER FAILS TO MOVE HIS STORIES ALONG QUICKLY, MAXIMIZING EMOTIONAL IMPACT AND FEATURING STRONG, DOWN-TO-EARTH CHARACTERS. HIS ENDINGS ALSO TEND TO DEPART FROM CONVENTION A BIT, REVEALING TRAGEDY WHERE THE WALK INTO THE SUNSET SHOULD BE. ALTHOUGH HE IS OFTEN CLASSIFIED AS A ROMANCE WRITER, SPARKS IS QUICK TO POINT OUT THAT HIS BOOKS DON'T REALLY SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS OF ROMANCE PUBLISHERS. INSTEAD, HE ADMITS TO WRITING LOVE STORIES, A DIFFERENT GENRE ALTOGETHER. WHATEVER HE CARES TO CALL THEM, ONE THING'S FOR SURE: NICHOLAS SPARKS CONTINUES TO STRIKE GOLD WITH HIS BITTERSWEET NOVELS OF LOVE AND LOSS.

2085@The C++ Programming Language@Addison-Wesley Professional@Addison-Wesley Professional@65000@THE NEW C++11 STANDARD ALLOWS PROGRAMMERS TO EXPRESS IDEAS MORE CLEARLY, SIMPLY, AND DIRECTLY, AND TO WRITE FASTER, MORE EFFICIENT CODE. BJARNE STROUSTRUP, THE DESIGNER AND ORIGINAL IMPLEMENTER OF C++, HAS REORGANIZED, EXTENDED, AND COMPLETELY REWRITTEN HIS DEFINITIVE REFERENCE AND TUTORIAL FOR PROGRAMMERS WHO WANT TO USE C++ MOST EFFECTIVELY. "THE C++ PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE, FOURTH EDITION, " DELIVERS METICULOUS, RICHLY EXPLAINED, AND INTEGRATED COVERAGE OF THE ENTIRE LANGUAGE--ITS FACILITIES, ABSTRACTION MECHANISMS, STANDARD LIBRARIES, AND KEY DESIGN TECHNIQUES. THROUGHOUT, STROUSTRUP PRESENTS CONCISE, "PURE C++11" EXAMPLES, WHICH HAVE BEEN CAREFULLY CRAFTED TO CLARIFY BOTH USAGE AND PROGRAM DESIGN. TO PROMOTE DEEPER UNDERSTANDING, THE AUTHOR PROVIDES EXTENSIVE CROSS-REFERENCES, BOTH WITHIN THE BOOK AND TO THE ISO STANDARD. NEW C++11 COVERAGE INCLUDESSUPPORT FOR CONCURRENCYREGULAR EXPRESSIONS, RESOURCE MANAGEMENT POINTERS, RANDOM NUMBERS, AND IMPROVED CONTAINERSGENERAL AND UNIFORM INITIALIZATION, SIMPLIFIED FOR-STATEMENTS, MOVE SEMANTICS, AND UNICODE SUPPORTLAMBDAS, GENERAL CONSTANT EXPRESSIONS, CONTROL OVER CLASS DEFAULTS, VARIADIC TEMPLATES, TEMPLATE ALIASES, AND USER-DEFINED LITERALSCOMPATIBILITY ISSUES TOPICS ADDRESSED IN THIS COMPREHENSIVE BOOK INCLUDEBASIC FACILITIES: TYPE, OBJECT, SCOPE, STORAGE, COMPUTATION FUNDAMENTALS, AND MOREMODULARITY, AS SUPPORTED BY NAMESPACES, SOURCE FILES, AND EXCEPTION HANDLINGC++ ABSTRACTION, INCLUDING CLASSES, CLASS HIERARCHIES, AND TEMPLATES IN SUPPORT OF A SYNTHESIS OF TRADITIONAL PROGRAMMING, OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING, AND GENERIC PROGRAMMINGSTANDARD LIBRARY: CONTAINERS, ALGORITHMS, ITERATORS, UTILITIES, STRINGS, STREAM I/O, LOCALES, NUMERICS, AND MORETHE C++ BASIC MEMORY MODEL, IN DEPTH THIS FOURTH EDITION MAKES C++11 THOROUGHLY ACCESSIBLE TO PROGRAMMERS MOVING FROM C++98 OR OTHER LANGUAGES, WHILE INTRODUCING INSIGHTS AND TECHNIQUES THAT EVEN CUTTING-EDGE C++11 PROGRAMMERS WILL FIND INDISPENSABLE. "THIS BOOK FEATURES AN ENHANCED, LAYFLAT BINDING, WHICH ALLOWS THE BOOK TO STAY OPEN MORE EASILY WHEN PLACED ON A FLAT SURFACE. THIS SPECIAL BINDING METHOD--NOTICEABLE BY A SMALL SPACE INSIDE THE SPINE--ALSO INCREASES DURABILITY."@
